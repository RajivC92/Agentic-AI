With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM\\'s pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources. [...] ## Process\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating an information-retrieval mechanism that allows models to access and utilize additional data beyond their original training set. Ars Technica notes that \"when new information becomes available, rather than having to retrain the model, all that’s needed is to augment the model’s external knowledge base with the updated information\" (\"augmentation\"). IBM states that \"in the generative phase, the LLM draws from the augmented prompt and its internal representation of its training data to synthesize an engaging answer tailored to the user in that instant\".\\n\\n### RAG key stages\\n\\n[edit] [...] RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don\\'t exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments.', 'score': 0.9650171, 'raw_content': None, 'favicon': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png'}, {'url': 'https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation', 'title': 'What is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)? - IBM', 'content': '# What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\\n\\n## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\\n\\nRetrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architecture for optimizing the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model by connecting it with external knowledge bases.

[...] ## Technical architecture of RAG\\n\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages both deep learning-based retrieval and sequence generation models to synthesize information effectively. The architecture combines the strength of a retriever to seek relevant context and a generator to create coherent text output.\\n\\n### Retrieval components\\n\\nRAG employs a dense retrieval mechanism, known as the Dense Passage Retriever (DPR), which retrieves document passages from a large corpus.

It primarily consists of a retrieval component and a generation component. The retrieval component is responsible for sourcing relevant data from a vast corpus, such as documents or databases.
