RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\\n\\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data. [...] Standard LLMs source information from their training datasets. RAG adds an information retrieval component to the AI workflow, gathering relevant information and feeding that to the generative AI model to enhance response quality and utility.\\n\\nRAG systems follow a five-stage process:\\n\\n1. The user submits a prompt.\\n2. The information retrieval model queries the knowledge base for relevant data.\\n3. Relevant information is returned from the knowledge base to the integration layer.\\n4. The RAG system engineers an augmented prompt to the LLM with enhanced context from the retrieved data.\\n5. The LLM generates an output and returns an output to the user. [...] ### The generator\\n\\nThe generator creates an output based on the augmented prompt fed to it by the integration layer. The prompt synthesizes the user input with the retrieved data and instructs the generator to consider this data in its response. Generators are typically pretrained language models, such as GPT, Claude or Llama.\\n\\n## What is the difference between RAG and fine-tuning?\\n\\nThe difference between RAG and fine-tuning is that RAG lets an LLM query an external data source while fine-tuning trains an LLM on domain-specific data. Both have the same general goal: to make an LLM perform better in a specified domain.', 'score': 0.9999875, 'raw_content': None, 'favicon': 'https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/adobe-cms/default-images/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png'}, {'url': 'https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/', 'title': 'What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?', 'content': '## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\\n\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization\\'s internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts. [...] Semantic search technologies can scan large databases of disparate information and retrieve data more accurately. For example, they can answer questions such as, \"How much was spent on machinery repairs last year?” by mapping the question to the relevant documents and returning specific text instead of search results. Developers can then use that answer to provide more context to the LLM. [...] RAG is one approach to solving some of these challenges. It redirects the LLM to retrieve relevant information from authoritative, pre-determined knowledge sources. Organizations have greater control over the generated text output, and users gain insights into how the LLM generates the response.\\n\\n## What are the benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\\n\\nRAG technology brings several benefits to an organization\\'s generative AI efforts.\\n\\n### Cost-effective implementation', 'score': 0.9999584, 'raw_content': None, 'favicon': 'https://a0.awsstatic.com/libra-css/images/site/touch-icon-ipad-144-smile.png'}, {'url': 'https://colabdoge.medium.com/what-is-rag-retrieval-augmented-generation-b0afc5dd5e79', 'title': 'What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)? | by Jacky', 'content': 'Applications\\n\\nRetrieval-augmented generation has several applications. For example, in question-answering systems, the retrieval-based model can find relevant passages or documents containing the answer, and the generative model can then generate a concise and coherent response based on that information. In content generation tasks, such as summarization or story writing, the retrieval-based model can provide relevant facts or context, which the generative model can use to create more informative and engaging content. [...] In summary, retrieval-augmented generation combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. By leveraging the retrieval-based model’s ability to find accurate information and the generative model’s ability to produce creative text, this approach enables more robust and contextually grounded language generation systems.\\n\\nBuilding your own RAG engine\\n\\nThere are a few solutions out there where you can test building your own RAG engine (I will be writing and sharing my experiences on these soon!). [...] 1. Retrieval models: These models are designed to retrieve relevant information from a given set of documents or a knowledge base. They typically use techniques like information retrieval or semantic search techniques to identify the most relevant pieces of information based on a given query. Retrieval-based models excel at finding accurate and specific information but lack the ability to generate creative or novel content.', 'score': 0.9999008, 'raw_content': None, 'favicon': None}, {'url': 'https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation', 'title': 'What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?', 'content': \"By fine-tuning or prompt-engineering the LLM to generate text entirely based on the retrieved knowledge, RAG helps to minimize contradictions and inconsistencies in the generated text. This significantly improves the quality of the generated text, and improves the user experience. [...] Retrieval and pre-processing: RAGs leverage powerful search algorithms to query external data, such as web pages, knowledge bases, and databases. Once retrieved, the relevant information undergoes pre-processing, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.\\n Grounded generation: The pre-processed retrieved information is then seamlessly incorporated into the pre-trained LLM. This integration enhances the LLM's context, providing it with a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
